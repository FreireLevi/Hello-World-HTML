*Hello World HTML/CSS*

This is a fancy "Hello World" I made while training HTML/CSS few months ago. With this activity I learned:
- The basic about HTML tags
- How to structure a HTML file
- How to properly index static images or GIF's on HTML
- Work with basic CSS stylization (Colors, fonts, margins, padding, etc).

Also learned more about:
- Directories (Folders, filesystems, etc)
- How browsers display web pages
- How to use Git# Hello-World-HTML
